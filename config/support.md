# base_local_planner_params.yaml
Contains configuration options for different local and global algorithms. Can be tuned to provide better movement

# costmap_common_params.yaml
Contains the configuration options for the costmap parameters. These can be adjusted to tune the costmap and thus where the robot thinks it shouldn't even get close to. Also contains the parameters for the robots footprint in association with the costmaps.

# global_costmap_params.yaml
